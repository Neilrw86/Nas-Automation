## Readarr Deployment Error in ArgoCD

**Problem:**

The Readarr deployment in ArgoCD was failing with the following error:

```
ComparisonError
rpc error: code = Unknown desc = Manifest generation error (cached): `helm dependency build` failed exit status 1: Error: can't get a valid version for repositories readarr. Try changing the version constraint in Chart.yaml
```

This error indicated that ArgoCD was unable to find a valid version of the `readarr` Helm chart in the specified repository.

**Root Cause:**

The ArgoCD application definition for `readarr` was pointing to a specific commit (`June`) in the GitOps repository. This commit likely contained an older version of the `helm_charts/readarr/Chart.yaml` file with a strict version constraint (`0.8.11`) that was no longer available in the chart repository.

**Solution:**

To resolve this issue, the `targetRevision` in the ArgoCD application definition (`argocd-apps/media-apps/readarr-app.yaml`) was updated to `main`. This ensures that ArgoCD always uses the latest version of the `Chart.yaml` file from the `main` branch, which now has a broader version constraint (`~0.8.0`).

**Changes Made:**

-   Modified `argocd-apps/media-apps/readarr-app.yaml`:
    -   Updated `targetRevision` from `June` to `July`.
-   Added `helm_charts/readarr/templates/NOTES.txt`:
    -   Added a logging statement to print the chart version.
-   Modified `helm_charts/readarr/Values.yaml`:
    -   Added `storageClass: null` and `volumeName: nfs-readarr-config-specific-pv` to the PVC configuration.
    -   Set `persistentVolumeClaims.readarr-config.enabled` to `false` to disable the default PVC creation.
