# This values.yaml is for your 'readarr-wrapper' chart.
# All configurations for the actual Readarr deployment will be under 'readarr-dependency'
# (the alias defined in Chart.yaml for the media-servarr/readarr chart).
#
# IMPORTANT: You MUST consult the official values.yaml of the media-servarr/readarr chart
# (version 0.8.11) for the precise structure and available options.
# The following is a best-effort configuration based on common patterns.
